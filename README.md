#### Massive Data Aggregation, Monitoring, Processing and Visualization with Open Source Software ####

This git repository will contain resources that we will be using during the tutorial Massive Data Aggregation, Monitoring, Processing and Visualization with Apache Flume, ElasticSearch and D3.js

The list of software we will be using can be found here

https://github.com/israelekpo/strataconf-ny-2013/blob/master/pre-requisite-software.md

There will be multiple tutorials running at the same time, and simultaneous downloads from multiple participants could be a large strain on the bandwidth and network resources. 

Please make an effort to download the necessary software before coming on site.

You can contact me at israel dot ekpo at gmail dot com if you have any questions or run into issues.


##### During the Tutorial #####
The code samples will be made available on github as well from this repository during the tutorial.

Installing and using git will make accessing the code samples easier.
